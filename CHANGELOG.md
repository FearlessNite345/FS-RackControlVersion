# Changelog v1.2.1
- Fixed an issue where unracking could fail due to a misconfigured client-side setting
- Added support for the Lation UI notification system

# Changelog v1.2.0
- Added options to disable the `/loadout` and `/armor` commands if you don’t want them available on your server
- Added ACE permission checks for all commands, allowing you to secure them using entries such as: `add_ace group.admin rackcontrol.loadout allow`

# Changelog v1.1.3

- Temporarily removed the walk-to-trunk feature due to ongoing issues. You can still unrack weapons while outside the vehicle, but there is currently no walking or animation. The feature will be reintroduced once it’s functioning properly.
